# CapitalystAngularUI

An extension UI for Capitalyst implemented in Angular.

Note that Capitalyst has an existing UI which is implemented in AngularJS. The
existing UI will be slowly migrated to Angular. This repository contains
the Angular implementation of the extended UI.

Both Angular and AngularJS UI will co-exist till the migration is completed.
AngularJS UI is included in the Capitalyst codebase.
